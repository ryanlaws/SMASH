# Troubleshooting

## It's too quiet.
Try any of the following.
- Plug something into the inputs
- Increase resonance 
- Increase noise (slowly)
- Increase leak (more slowly)
- Increase gain (**VERY** slowly)

## Encoder movements aren't being recorded.
Only E2 is recorded. 
E2 is only recorded during the record phase. 
You can change E2's control while recording, but only one control/value is recorded per SMASH.

## It's too noisy.
Decrease resonance, noise, leak, and/or gain.

## I have no idea what's going on
See PARAMETERS menu.
