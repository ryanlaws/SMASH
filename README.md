# SMASH
Sequencer for apes üçå

# !WARNING!

Can get **VERY LOUD!!!** Protect your ears, ape!

# Controls

K2 = **SMASH**

K3 = arm/play

K1 + E2 = select E2 control

K1 + E3 = select E3 control

E2 = control something

E3 = control something else

# Troubleshooting

## It's too quiet.
Try any of the following.
- Plug something into the inputs
- Turn up the resonance 
- Turn up the noise (slowly)
- Turn up the leak (more slowly)
- Turn up the gain (**VERY** slowly)

## My encoder movements aren't being recorded.
Only E2 is recorded. 
It is only recorded during the record phase. 
You may change the E2 control during recording and record that, but only one control will be recorded per event.
